                            <p>Judie and Z. met in the fall of 2007 when Z. was hired at Digitaria as a project manager. Judie had just started a few weeks prior as the new receptionist. It would be nice to say that it was love at first sight, however, they unfortunately did not hit it off right away. If you asked Z., he would probably say that she had just never met anyone like him before. If you asked Judie she would probably say that she initially was just not that impressed. Luckily Z. is persistent or, at the very least, stubborn.</p>

                            <h3 class="ir heading-history-2008">IN CAHOOTS WITH CUPID</h3>
                            <p>After several months of getting to know each other around the office, and a partially ignored "charm offensive" on the part of Z., the two of them started to hang out some outside of the office. We'd like pause here for a moment to acknowledge the role that Kate Gaffney, friend of the couple and member of the bridal party, played in making all this happen. If we didn't, she would never let us forget it. Basically, she and Z. were in cahoots.</p>
                            <p>During a celebration for his 28th birthday, Z. asked Judie on a date. A few days later, they went on their first date on the Ocean Terrace at George's at the Cove. At the time, it was the fanciest restaurant that Judie had ever been to. Within a month, they were officially a couple.  </p>

                            <p>Judie and Z. decided to make the leap and move in together. They got a lovely loft apartment in downtown San Diego after Z. had been living by the beach for more than six years. They were just two kids in love, and didn't manage to put anything up on the walls until about three months before they moved out. Z. quickly learned that the rice cooker always stayed on top of the counter and that sometimes Judie cleaning things is the same as misplacing things.</p>
                            <p>The happy couple also added a new member to the team when Z. bought Judie a puppy for her 24th birthday. After a rough first couple of nights, Zoli quickly became a part of the family. Judie and Zoli started to attend puppy classes at the humane society, mostly for Judie's sake. She wont admit it, but she was a little scared of an eight week old Zoli.</p>

                            <p>2010 was a big year. The happy couple made the big decision to move across the country to The Windy City. Why anyone would leave 70 and sunny for cold and windy is debatable, but Judie and Z. both made lists of cities they would like to live in and the lists didn't match. Luckily, Chicago just happened to be the perfect compromise.</p> 
                            <p>In August, they packed up everything they owned, threw Zoli in the front seat and got ready for a 2000 mile drive in a cherry red Ford Mustang listening to Katy Perry's Teenage Dream (while Z. was sleeping, of course!). Some of the highlights of that trip were seeing some amazing natural scenery, Zoli "smelling" a cactus, and sleeping in a Motel 6 in America's largest truck stop, where a murder had more than likely occurred.</p>

I have lived with him on two coasts, been completely broke with him, been flush, partied all night, worked long hours, and a hundred other things. When I think back on my best memories he is there for a lot of them and will continue to be. I couldn't ask for a better person to be my Best Man.</p>

Wherever we are in the world he’s one of the people I reach out to, sharing my victories and my losses. We grew up together from, playing with toys, first dates, starting college, moving out on our own, and now starting our own families, Chip has been there with me through it all.</p>
                        <p>If you had all the clothes that Chip has lost over the years, either his own or that were borrowed from me, you could dress the entire wedding party. Twice.</p>

He's been keeping me honest for the last 15 years and I have been trying to keep him out of trouble. Neither of us is always successful. Justin always keeps it real, because that's all he knows how to do. If you ask him for his opinion about something you'll never be disappointed.</p>
                        <p>I have seen the movie "Tombstone" with Justin probably 100 times. I have no good explanation for that, but it is an American classic.</p>

That's how I feel about Anthony. I was lucky enough to be introduced to him by some of his fellow Maderans more than a decade ago. The good times are getting a little mellower, but we've been having them ever since.</p>

We managed to figure a lot of it out together and make a lot of great memories along the way, both back in school and in San Diego.</p>
                        <p>Nick Barker is kind of scared of spiders. Needless to say I have chased him while holding one.</p>

                        <p>In my entire life I have only met one person who didn't love Radovan. I hate that person. You won't meet someone more outgoing or enthusiastic. He's the kind of guy who will put you in a better mood just by being around. We've been friends almost 20 years and he's been that way since I met him. I consider myself fortunate to have him as a friend.</p>
                        <p>He will deny it but I taught Radovan to swim. It happened way more recently than you would guess.</p>

                        <p>When Adam and I first met he actually complained to Nick and Nate that I was being mean to him. I don't let him forget that, but he managed to get over it and we've been friends ever since. I can think of a lot of times when I had to be the "voice of reason " for him, and a few where he has had to do it for me. We have had a lot of good times over the years and I am always glad that we will continue to have them.</p>
                        <p>You may hear people call Adam, "Hoss." If you hear someone call him "Hurricane Hoss," run away.</p>

                        <p>I've known Nate since the 90's and I can probably count on both hands the number of times I have seen him in a bad mood. Nate is another one of those people you can't help but love. His attitude is always infectious and he's the kind of guy you will always want around. Even as I think back about how different we all were as kids when we first met, all the qualities that make Nate a good guy and a great friend haven't changed.</p>
                        <p>All Nate and my arguments end with me asking him to cite his sources, then him telling me to shut up.</p>

We met in 2005 and over the  years, she has become one of my very best friends. She is particularly excited for the wedding, as her support for straight marriage has been unwavering. Even though she's busy traveling the world, she still makes a point to be there for me.</p>

                        <p>Kate and I met when I got a job at Digitaria taking over her role as the new receptionist. We became really good work buddies and over time, really great friends. During the beginning of our friendship, I had no idea she was working as a double agent for Z. That's just how good she is. Now she's in LA pursuing her dreams and I'm in Chicago pursuing mine. And when we get together, we pick up right where we left off... making funny Asian jokes.</p>

                        <p>Maddy and I met shortly after graduating high school. We had so much in common (middle name, last name, we both were manicurists), we started telling people we were related. We decided to become roomies in 2006 and lived together for a year. During that time, we've had plenty of fond memories, including the time we wore the cutest shoes to Tijuana and couldn't walk back to the car or once, we left the doctor's office with burnt fingers and were so pitiful, we started whining in Vietnamese. Good times.</p>

I've never met anyone else who enjoys food as much as she does. If you bump into her at the wedding, be sure to thank her for all the delicious sweets at the dessert table. And don't forget to try her dreamt up cocktail, SugaWataPinq (which Z. named). Seriously, she dreamt the recipe. Ask her.</p>

We both were notorious for running on Asian time, and even if we didn't like being punctual, we sure liked to have fun. We spent a lot of nights partying at Jeff's house (remember that?!), feasting on carna asada fries at late night burrito shops or hanging out at the beach. We don't see each other as often these days, mostly because she's in the Bay Area and I'm in the MidWest, but I know she'll be a life-long friend.</p>

It was definitely a heart-to-heart moment when he shared his wisdom with me. I will never forget the words he spoke because it really resonated: Don't get your meat, where you get your bread. And if anyone loves a good bargain, it's kChu. I almost had him help me with the wedding vendors.</p>
